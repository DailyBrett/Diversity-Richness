## Dataset
Name: __Diversity-Richness__
This is a dataset collected by the US Census Bureau for the ACS 2021 (Five Year Estimate) Survey which includes city-level data on population numbers, demographic numbers, and several other community-wide measures. I downloaded this data from the Social Explorer website, and then edited it into a usable format using RStudio. I will be using this dataset for my master's thesis project where I will compare the data on well-being collected by Dr. Oishi's lab in order to see if there is any correlation between community-level rates of racial diversity and individual rates of psychological richness. I have added this edited dataset, the original downloaded datasets, and the file I used for editing all to the shared repo.
