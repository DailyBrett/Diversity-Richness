## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
helloworld <- function(name, title, month_num, military_time) { #set the three inputs
  formality <- if (title == TRUE) {formality <- "Greetings "
  } else {formality <- "Hey "} #a funtion that changes formality of greeting based on if there is a title
  # Initialize season
  if (month_num %in% c(1, 2, 12)) {season <- "Winter"} #Output winter
  else if (month_num %in% 3:5) {season <- "Spring"} #Output spring
  else if (month_num %in% 6:8) {season <- "Summer"} #Output summer
  else if (month_num %in% 9:11) {season <- "Fall"} #Output fall
  paste0(formality, name, ", how are you? ", "I hope you are having a lovely ", season, "! ", added_greeting)
  #fill in the name and put pieces together
}
```




```{r cars}
greeting <- function(name) {
  paste("Hello ", name, "!")
}

helloworld <- function(name, title, month_num) {
  formality <- if (title == TRUE) {formality <- "Greetings "
  } else {formality <- "Hey "} 
     if (month_num == 1:2) {season <-"Winter"}
     else if (month_num == 12) {season <- "Winter"}
     else if (month_num == 3:5) {season <- "Spring"}
     else if (month_num == 6:8) {season <- "Summer"}
     else if (month_num == 9:11) {season <- "Fall"}
   }
  paste0(formality, name, ", how are you? ", "I hope you are having a lovely ", season)
}

name <- "Dowling"
title <- TRUE
month_num <- 12
helloworld(name, title, month_num)

```


```{r}
helloworld <- function(name, title, month_num) { #set the three inputs
  formality <- if (title == TRUE) {formality <- "Greetings "
  } else {formality <- "Hey "} #a funtion that changes formality of greeting based on if there is a title
  if (month_num == 1:2) {season <- "Winter"}
     else if (month_num == 12) {season <- "Winter"}
     else if (month_num == 3:5) {season <- "Spring"}
     else if (month_num == 6:8) {season <- "Summer"}
     else if (month_num == 9:11) {season <- "Fall"}
  paste0(formality, name, ", how are you? ", "I hope you are having a lovely ", season, "!")
}
  #fill in the name and put pieces together
  
  #practice using the helloworld function
name <- "Dr. Dowling" #sample name
title <- TRUE #sample title
month_num <- 12 #sample month
helloworld(name, title, month_num) #sample function
}

```

```{r}
helloworld <- function(name, title, month_num) {
  # Initialize formality
  formality <- if (title) {
    "Greetings "
  } else {
    "Hey "
  }
  
  # Initialize season
  if (month_num %in% c(1, 2, 12)) {
    season <- "Winter"
  } else if (month_num %in% 3:5) {
    season <- "Spring"
  } else if (month_num %in% 6:8) {
    season <- "Summer"
  } else if (month_num %in% 9:11) {
    season <- "Fall"
  }
  
  paste0(formality, name, ", how are you? ", "I hope you are having a lovely ", season, "!")
}

name <- "Dr. Dowling" #sample name
title <- TRUE #sample title
month_num <- 12 #sample month
helloworld(name, title, month_num) #sample function


```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
