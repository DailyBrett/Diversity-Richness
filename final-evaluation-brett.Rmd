## Report plan summary

Report Plan

+ Plan 1: Skelton Table Analysis
+ Data: Skelton Chart and Census Data
+ As previously discussed with Dr. Dowling, I was having some trouble getting access to the data from my lab since my inclusion into the IRB was delayed. Therefore, my lab manager sent me a skeleton version of the data which included all the relevant zip codes and some public, non-confidential information. 
+ I will use this skeleton data to run a mock version of my data analysis by filling out the data with mock numbers. 
+ Analysis: Diversity on Psych Richness
+ I will be analyzing the relationship between ZIP code level racial diversity and participantsâ€™ scores of psychological richness (a well-being measure) 
+ I will run a model on the relationship between the two including multiple potential compounds (income, region, etc.) and a couple potential interaction affects (walkability, racial integration)
+ Include a linear model table
+ Include a smooth graph on the relationship
+ Potential Boxplot chart based on zip code or city area
+ Text: 
+ Already written a lengthy literature review for my thesis process which will take up most of the 1500 words
+ I have a mostly finished version of my methods as well.
+ Since I am using a skeleton table for my data, I will not provide a completed data analysis/results/discussion. But will instead include small sections on what results I expect to find. 
+ Chunks
+ Referenced chunks will include: rounded means of the relevant scores, a p score for my model, and the results of the interaction vs regular effects
+ Goals  
+ Since I have not yet received the IRB approval from my lab as I was hoping for, I had to slightly change the goals I have for this assignment. Instead of fully running a model to actually address the relationship between diversity and richness already, I will instead focusing on learning how to run such an analysis in R and how to format such a manuscript in R. In this assignment, therefore, I will aim to produce a complete analysis (with the sufficient charts, tables, and discussion sections) so that I can just plug in my data as soon as I fully get access to it.  
+ Plan 2: Previously Used Data
+ Data: Current Census Data
+ Also as previous discussed with Dr. Dowling, if for some reason the skeleton table does not work for the purpose of this assignment, I will instead run analysis using the variables I already have access to through the publicly available Census Data I have been using for this course. 
+ Analysis: Diversity on Median Household Income
+ In this backup scenario, I will likely do analysis on the relationship between diversity and region on Median Household Income (as I have been doing so far up to this point in the course. 
+ Include a linear model table
+ Include a smooth graph on the relationship
+ Potential Box chart based on zip code or city area
+ Text: 
+ In this scenario, I would likely need to write a new mock literature review to reflect the research question I would be addressing. 
+ I could likely include much of the same research methods section however
+ I would also be able to now mostly write a full analysis and discussion section, since I would have the full data.
+ Chunks
+ Referenced chunks will include: rounded means of the relevant scores, a p score for my model, and the results of the interaction vs regular effects
+ Goals 
+ In this scenario, I would mostly be practicing using the tools I will eventually need for my thesis project and would thus focus on setting up a project that would mirror my future project as closely as possible. 

# Assessment

The lists of expectations in each category are to help you understand the kinds of things I'm looking for as I grade. These **do not** map onto point values. A checked box indicates the expectation was met or exceeded. (This also helps me spot patterns across students to identify ways I can improve the syllabus and lectures for future students.)

Ratings indicate overall success for each category and loosely map onto points. Starting from 20 points, no points are lost for the highest rating, -3 for the lowest, and somewhere in between for the middle ratings. Points lost in that range are dependent on how many issues there are, how much they matter, whether it's technicality vs problem of consequence, whether it's the same core issue that lost you points in a different section, whether exceeding expectations elsewhere compensate for a small issue, whether it's something we talked about in your report plan meeting, etc. 

Additional comments are included below the ratings as needed. Final project and class grades are included at the end of the document.

**WARNING: Grades for this assignment are going to be lower than you expect!** Don't freak out. I use "specs-based grading", which works very differently from the letter-grade-to-percentage conversion you are probably used to. It's more like Harry Potter OWLs -- 19/20 is outstanding, 16-18 exceeds expectations (not a C!), 13-15 meets expectations (not an F!), etc. You're not down to T(roll) until you're in the negatives. Remember this is only 20% of your final grade!

**Rating:**

- [x] Perfect match
- [ ] At least one minor problem
- [ ] At least one major problem and/or multiple minor problems
- [ ] Multiple major problems
- [ ] Prohibitive error(s), missing PDF, or significant problems

*No additional comments*

## Data read-in, prep, wrangling

**Expectations:**

- [x] Data preparation and wrangling code present (may separate files)
- [x] Intermediate datasets (if used) are functional and read in successfully
- [x] Raw or intermediate data read into .Rmd code chunk
- [x] All code in .R files and .Rmd code chunks is sufficiently commented and comprehensible
- [x] Additional expectations set in the report plan (if any) are met

**Rating:**

Great! I appreciate the informative comments in your prep file

## Figures, tables, analyses

### Figures

**Expectations:**

- [ ] At least 2 plots are produced in .Rmd chunks (not imported images)
- [x] Figures are different kinds of plots 
- [x] Figures follow report plan (may have inconsequential deviations)

- [x] Additional expectations set in the report plan (if any) are met

**Rating:**

- [x] No noteworthy issues 
- [ ] At least one minor problem
- [ ] At least one major problem and/or multiple minor problems
- [ ] Multiple major problems
- [ ] Prohibitive errors or significant problems

Beautiful! I think I'll likely be looking at your code for examples when I eventually learn the stargazer package.

### Analysis

**Expectations:**

If you included more than the one required analysis (or other requirements agreed on in the report plan), only one needs to meet expectations.
