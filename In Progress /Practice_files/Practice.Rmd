This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r Exampler, fig.cap= "Example"}

# Create the boxplot
ggplot(Zipcode_with_Zones, aes(x = Zipcode_Zone, y = X_Total_Population_White_Alone, fill = Zipcode_Zone)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  labs(x = "ZIP Code Zones", y = "Percentage White",
       title = "Percentage of Population White by Zip Code Region", fill = "Zone Names") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())


```

I need to refernce "Figure\ \@ref(fig:Exampler)"
